# my [neptune](https://github.com/uwu/neptune) plugins
This is a repository containing every plugin I have made for the [neptune](https://github.com/uwu/neptune) client mods.

## AdBlock
AdBlock blocks TIDAL Free ads.

## Fake HiFi
Fake HiFi tricks the app into thinking you have HiFi, allowing you to get access to lyrics and other HiFi only features. NOTE: This does not give you access to higher sound qualities than "Low".

## Discord RPC
Discord RPC shows the song you're currently listening to on Discord.

## Song Share
Allows you to send a song from the TIDAL mobile app to TIDAL desktop via the share sheet.

iOS users: you can install the shortcut [here](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/16299/)

Android users: you can sideload the neptune songshare app [here](https://github.com/uwu/neptune-songshare-android/releases/latest)

TODO: In the future I would like to add a web GUI to Song Share so that you can control the volume, pause, play, skip, and seek from your mobile device.
